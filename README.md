# Clustering Analysis with PyCaret

## Introduction
This project performs clustering analysis on the Glass Identification dataset using PyCaret and the UCI Machine Learning Repository API. The goal is to explore different clustering models, evaluate their performance under various preprocessing scenarios, and provide insights into the dataset's underlying patterns.

## Prerequisites
Make sure to install the required Python packages using the following commands:

```bash
pip install ucimlrepo
pip install pycaret
```

## Code Overview
The code fetches the Glass Identification dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, preprocesses it using PyCaret's setup function, and then applies various clustering models with different preprocessing configurations. The clustering models are chosen based on their index in the PyCaret model list.

## Usage
Execute the provided Python script (your_script_name.py) to run the clustering analysis. The script includes the following steps:

- Install required packages.
- Fetch the Glass Identification dataset.
- Preprocess the data using PyCaret's setup function.
- Apply different clustering models with various preprocessing scenarios.
- Save the results for each model and preprocessing configuration in CSV files.
- Results
- The results are saved in CSV files, each corresponding to a specific clustering model. The CSV files provide insights into the performance of each model under different preprocessing conditions and cluster sizes.

## Configurations
The script explores the following preprocessing configurations:
- No Data Processing
- Using Normalization
- Using Transform
- Using PCA
- T+N (Transform + Normalize)
- T+N+PCA (Transform + Normalize + PCA)

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the versatility of PyCaret in clustering analysis and provides a comprehensive overview of different models and preprocessing strategies. The results and insights obtained can be valuable for understanding the structure of the Glass Identification dataset.
